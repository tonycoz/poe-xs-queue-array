POE::XS::Queue::Array is an implementation of the POE::Queue XS interface.

Unlike POE, you need a C compiler to install this module.

To install do:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install  # you may need to be root for this step

This module should be considered experimental for now, there are
optimizations that could be performed that aren't, see perldoc
POE::XS::Queue::Array for details.

This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
modify it under the same terms as Perl itself.
