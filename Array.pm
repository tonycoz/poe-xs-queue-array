=head1 NAME

POE::XS::Queue::Array - an XS implementation of POE::Queue::Array.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

See POE::Queue.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class is an implementation of the abstract POE::Queue interface.
It implements a priority queue using C, with an XS interface supplied.

The current implementation could use some optimization, especially for
large queues.

Please see the POE::Queue documentation, which explains this one's
functions, features, and behavior.

The following extra methods are added beyond POE::Queue::Array:

=over

=item dump

Dumps the internal structure of the queue to stderr.

=item verify

Does limited verification of the structure of the queue.  If the
verification fails then a message is sent to stderr and the queue is
dumped as with the dump() method, and your program will exit.

=head1 SEE ALSO

POE, POE::Queue, POE::Queue::Array

=head1 BUGS

None known.

Some possible improvements include:

=over

=item *

use a B-Tree for the queue (not a binary tree, a B-Tree), though this
would require a module rename.

=item *

use a custom hash instead of a HV for the id to priority mapping,
either glib's hash or convert to C++ and use the STL map.

=item *

some of the XS code could be optimized to do less work in scalar
context, pq_remove_items and pq_peek_items could avoid building all
those array refs.
