Revision history for Perl extension POE::XS::Queue::Array.

0.002
 - moved the structural queue code to queue.c, Array.xs is purely an
   interface to that now.
 - replaced all the opaque memmove() calls with a call to pq_move_items() 
   which does sanity checks in DEBUG code.
 - added t/02_release.t which attempts to check we're handling references 
   correctly.
 - added Imager's memory debugging code in an attempt to find the
   crash problem on Win32.  This seems to have eliminated the crash
   even when it's disabled (and just calls malloc/free/realloc)

 - found the memory leak - we were creating an SV for the id to
   priority hash and nothing was releasing it
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=20018
 - the memory leak fix has become obsolete, we now avoid creating the
   SV at all by using the id in memory as a key to the hash.
 - added a verify method during debugging, it's not necessary anymore
   but someone else fiddling with the code might find it useful
 - pq_find_item() and pq_insertion_point() now use a binary search for
   larger queues.  These were the hotspots going by sprof profiling.
