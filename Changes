Revision history for Perl extension POE::XS::Queue::Array.

0.002
 - moved the structural queue code to queue.c, Array.xs is purely an
   interface to that now.
 - replaced all the opaque memmove() calls with a call to pq_move_items() 
   which does sanity checks in DEBUG code.
 - added t/02_release.t which attempts to check we're handling references 
   correctly.

0.001
 - initial release
